PrxPass Server
===

PrxPass is a reverse-proxy server that behaves like ngrok, localtunnel, etc.
It's a self-hosted solution, so you need a server.

## Usage

```
prxpass-server -h
```

## Configuration

See `config.example.toml`.

## Client

See [prxpass-client](//github.com/Defman21/prxpass-client) for information about connecting to the server.
